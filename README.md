# react-isomorphic

Barebones Isomorphic React app.

### Why did I create this?
I found that many of the boilerplates included really complicated code. For someone that has little to no experience with node, I found this to be a hard way to learn how to create the setup I desired. I had several goals I wanted to accomplish:
* Render react server side
* Use node/express to handle rendering server side
* Hot reloading using webpack
* Use webpack both server and client-side
* Use CSS Modules
* Use React Router
